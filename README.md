# Data to text:  text generation model
## How to build a large language model on specific datasets.

1. features.py: data dictionary for understanding the meaning of features.
2. data_process.py: including data pre-processing and creation of ground truth.
3. tokenize_dataset_rows.py: text data tokenization.
4. chatglm_lora_tuning.py: training ChatGLM-6B with LoRA tuning method.
5. model_inference&ROUGE.ipynb: interacting with the model and obtain corresponding predictions, conducting ROUGE analysis on testing set.
7. traningLoss&cosineSimilarity.ipynb: visualising the training loss and using cosine similarity to compare responses.
